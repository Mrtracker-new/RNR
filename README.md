## 🧐 What is this?

Yo! 👋 This is my personal corner of the internet. It's not just a portfolio; it's a collection of the cool stuff I've built, stripped of corporate jargon and packed with personality. I built this to show off my skills without putting you to sleep. 😴

## ⚡ Why it's Awesome (Speed & Stats)

We don't do slow websites here. 🙅‍♂️

- 🏎️ **Zoom Zoom**: 94+ Lighthouse score (Google loves me).
- 📦 **Tiny Footprint**: ~143KB bundle size.
- 🎯 **Lazy As Heck**: Lazy loading everything so your data plan thanks you.
- 🧈 **Smooth as Butter**: 60fps animations because jank is for amateurs.

## ✨ usage == fun?

### 🎨 The Vibe
- **Dark Mode Only**: Because light attracts bugs. 🦟 (Just kidding, but seriously, my dark mode is sleek).
- **Glassmorphism**: It's like looking through a frosted window at future technology.
- **Responsive**: Looks good on your phone, your laptop, and your smart fridge (probably).

### � The Goods (Pages)
- **🏠 Home**: The grand entrance.
- **👨‍💻 About**: The lore, the backstory, the "who is this guy?".
- **🛠️ Projects**: The trophy room. Filter, search, and marvel at the code.
- **📞 Contact**: Slide into my DMs (professionally, please).
- **📝 Blog**: My brain dumps on [Hashnode](https://rnr-still-figuring-things-out.hashnode.dev/).

## 🛠️ Under the Hood

I used the good stuff:

| Tech | Why? |
|------|------|
| **React 19** | Because living on the bleeding edge is fun. |
| **TypeScript** | Because `undefined` is not a function. |
| **Styled Components** | CSS in JS? Yes please. |
| **Framer Motion** | Makes things go *whoosh* and *spin*. |
| **React Helmet Async** | SEO magic so people can actually find me. |

## 🚀 Let's Get This Party Started (Local Setup)

Want to break things locally? Be my guest!

**Prerequisites**: Node.js (v16+) and a sense of adventure.

```bash
# 1. Kidnap the code
git clone https://github.com/Mrtracker-new/RNR.git

# 2. Enter the matrix
cd portfolio

# 3. Feed the beast (install dependencies)
npm install

# 4. IGNITE! 🔥
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and witness the greatness. 🥂

### 🔧 Environment Secrets
Create a `.env` file if you want the blog to work properly:
```env
REACT_APP_HASHNODE_PUBLICATION_HOST=your-blog.hashnode.dev
```
