# Netlify Forms Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use Netlify Forms for the portfolio contact form.

## What is Netlify Forms?

Netlify Forms is a built-in feature of Netlify hosting that automatically handles form submissions without requiring any backend server or external services. It's perfect for static sites that need contact forms.

## Benefits of Netlify Forms

- **No configuration needed** - Works automatically when deployed on Netlify
- **No API keys required** - Unlike EmailJS, no environment variables or secret keys needed
- **Built-in spam protection** - Includes honeypot fields and reCAPTCHA integration
- **Form submission notifications** - Get email notifications for new submissions
- **Free tier included** - 100 form submissions per month on the free plan

## How It Works

The contact form is already configured with the required Netlify Forms attributes:

```html
<form name="contact" method="POST" data-netlify="true" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="contact" />
  <!-- form fields -->
</form>
```

### Key Attributes:
- `name="contact"` - Identifies the form in Netlify dashboard
- `method="POST"` - Required for form submission
- `data-netlify="true"` - Enables Netlify Forms processing
- Hidden `form-name` field - Required for JavaScript-rendered forms (React)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Deploy to Netlify
Make sure your portfolio is deployed on Netlify. You can deploy by:
- Connecting your GitHub repository to Netlify
- Using Netlify CLI: `netlify deploy --prod`
- Dragging and dropping the build folder to Netlify dashboard

### 2. Verify Form Detection
After deployment:
1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Navigate to **Forms** tab
3. You should see the "contact" form listed

### 3. Configure Form Settings (Optional)
In the Netlify dashboard under Forms, you can:
- Set up email notifications for new submissions
- Add custom success/error pages
- Enable spam filtering options
- Export submissions as CSV

### 4. Test the Form
1. Visit your deployed portfolio
2. Fill out and submit the contact form
3. Check the Netlify dashboard to see the submission
4. Verify you receive email notifications (if configured)

## Form Submissions

All form submissions are stored in the Netlify dashboard under the Forms section. You can:
- View all submissions with timestamps
- Export submissions as CSV
- Set up email notifications
- Download individual submissions

## Troubleshooting

### Form Not Showing Up in Dashboard
- Ensure the form has `data-netlify="true"` attribute
- Make sure the hidden `form-name` input exists
- Redeploy the site after making form changes

### Submissions Not Working
- Check that the form method is "POST"
- Verify the form name matches the hidden input value
- Ensure JavaScript form submission prevents default browser behavior

### 404 Errors on Submission
- The form should submit to the same page ("/")
- Make sure the fetch request URL is correct
- Check that Netlify is properly processing the form

## Form Limits

### Free Plan:
- 100 form submissions per month
- Basic spam protection
